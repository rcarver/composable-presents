# ComposablePresents

Presentation and dismissal for [ComposableArchitecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/).

## Purpose

This package attempts to provide a simple to use and complete solution to 
managing presentation and dismissal of state and long running effects.

For our purposes, *presentation* is defined as creating some non-nil state
for the purpose for working in a new domain, then destroying that state
(setting to nil) to end work in tha domain. In TCA, creating this new domain 
is often paired with kicking off long-running effects which must be carefully 
cancelled before the state becomes nil. 

This dance of cancelling effects, then setting state to nil is error-prone
and requires additional lifecycle actions to get right.

## Basics

To make this easier, `ComposablePresents` provides a set of property wrappers
that model the full lifecycle of presentation and dismissal. Paired with
a higher-order reducer that performs presentation state transitions along
with managing effects.

The property wrapper comes in flavors for `Optional` state, `Identified` state, 
`enum` state, and `IdentifiedArray`s.

```swift
struct WorldState: Equatable {
  @PresentsAny var person: PersonState?
}
```

The `presents` higher-order reducer takes a `Presenter` which performs
actions when the state is presented and dismissed. A `Presenter` can be
derived from a `Reducer` in many cases.

```swift
Reducer { state, action, environment in
  ...
}
  .presents(
    state: \.$person,
    action: /Action.person,
    environment: \.person,
    presenter: .longRunning(PersonReducer)
  )
```

With these two pieces in place, you're free to use TCA as normal and set
`state.person` to an honest value or nil value and any long-running effects 
performed by the `PersonReducer` will be started and cancelled automatically.

## Types of Presentation

Variations of the property wrapper support patterns for modeling optional state.

```swift
/// Perform presentation when the value changes from nil to non-nil.
@PresentsAny var value: SomeValue?
```

```swift
/// Perform presentation when the value moves from nil to non-nil, 
/// or if the ID of the value changes. 
@PresentsOne var value: SomeIdentifiableValue?
```

```swift
/// Perform presentation any element is added or removed from the array.
@PresentsEach var value: IdentifiedArrayOf<SomeValue> = []
```

Note that `@PresentsOne` supports both enum and struct types that implement `Identifiable`.
An enum can implement `Identifiable` fairly easily, for example:

```swift
extension MyEnum: Identifiable {
  var id: AnyHashable {
    case .firstCase(let value): return value.id
    case .secondCase: return "second"
  }
}

## Example

Following is an example using all features of the library.

**The child/presented domain** ‚Äî

```swift
struct PersonState: Equatable {
  var name: String
  var age: Int
}

// ‚≠êÔ∏è Action implements `LongRunningAction`, allowing it to be used
// directly as a presenter.
enum PersonAction: Equatable, LongRunningAction {
  case begin
  case cancel
  case setAge(Int)
}

struct PersonEnvironment {
  var years: () -> Effect<Int, Never>
  var mainQueue: AnySchedulerOf<DispatchQueue>
}

enum PersonEffect {}

let personReducer = Reducer<PersonState, PersonAction, PersonEnvironment>.combine(
  Reducer { state, action, environment in
    switch action {
    case .setAge(let age):
      state.age = age
      return .none
  
    // ‚≠êÔ∏è For `LongRunningAction`, start any effects.
    case .begin:
      return environment.years()
        .receive(on: environment.mainQueue)
        .eraseToEffect(PersonAction.setAge)
        .cancellable(id: PersonEffect.self)
        
    // ‚≠êÔ∏è For `LongRunningAction`, cancel any effects.
    case .cancel:
      return .cancel(id: PersonEffect.self)
    }
  }
)
```

**The parent/presenter domain** ‚Äî

```swift
struct WorldState: Equatable {
  // ‚≠êÔ∏è Property wrapper for presenting any state
  @PresentsAny var person: PersonState?
}

enum WorldAction: Equatable {
  case born
  case died
  case person(PersonAction)
}

struct WorldEnvironment {
  var years: () -> Effect<Int, Never>
  var mainQueue: AnySchedulerOf<DispatchQueue>
  var person: PersonEnvironment { .init(years: years, mainQueue: mainQueue) }
}

let reducer = Reducer<WorldState, WorldAction, WorldEnvironment>.combine(
  // üëÄ Optional pullback, independent of presentation.
  personReducer.optional().pullback(
    state: \.person,
    action: /WorldAction.person,
    environment: \.person
  ),
  Reducer { state, action, environment in
    switch action {
    case .born:
      // ‚≠êÔ∏è Set state to an honest value, triggering presentation 
      state.person = .init(name: "John", age: 0)
      return .none
    case .died:
      // ‚≠êÔ∏è Set state to an nil value, triggering dismissal
      state.person = nil
      return .none
    case .person:
      return .none
    }
  }
    // ‚≠êÔ∏è Attach `presents` reducer to property wrapper.
    .presents(
      state: \.$person,
      action: /WorldAction.person,
      environment: \.person,
      // ‚≠êÔ∏è Convert `personReducer` to `Presenter` because it 
      // implements `LongRunningAction`
      presenter: .longRunning(personReducer)
    )
)
```

### Custom Presenter

If you can't or don't want to implement `LongRunningAction`, creating
a custom or ad-hoc `Presenter` is simple.

```swift
Reducer { state, action, environment in
  ...
}
  .presents(
    state: \.$person,
    action: /Action.person,
    environment: \.person,
    presenter: .init { state, action, environment in 
      switch action {
      case .present:
        return Effect(value: .your_custom_effect)
      case .dismiss:
        return Effect(value: .your_custom_effect)
      }
    }
  )
```

The presenter is given the presented state (or the last honest state
when dismissed), a `PresentationAction` (`present`, `dismiss`), and the 
environment. Custom presenters can perform any additional side-effects 
beyond what the reducer defines.

**Note:** be sure that any effects sent from the `dismiss` action do
not feed back into the system (use `.fireAndforget` and `.cancel`) 
because the state will be nil. 

## Testing

## Other libraries

This library builds on much frustration in this area of [ComposableArchitecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/), 
which is still an incredible framework that I use every day.
